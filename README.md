# About my interest in programming.

The reason why I got interested in coding is the constant need for development, which is combined with my love for learning. Learning the new technologies and gaining knowledge gives me satisfaction, and also goes hand in hand with practical skills. Another reason, which made me focus my attention on programming is the possibility of pure creation, which means creating something extremely useful from scratch. Programming skills provide almost unlimited possibilities in the field of creating useful things. Knowledge and skills from the subject of pure creation have always fascinated me, and that's why coding is another (along with woodworking, Arduino and 3D printing) subject of continuous self-development which expands creative possibilities. Participation in Motorola Academy will allow me to quickly gain professional knowledge and valuable skills, which I will use to realize ambitious challenges.
